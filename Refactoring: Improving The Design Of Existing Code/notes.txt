Title: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
Author: Martin Fowler 

Chapter 1

	- When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program's code is not structured
		in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add
		the feature, then add the feature. 

	- Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must
		be self checking.
